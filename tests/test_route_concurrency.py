"""Guard against event-loop-blocking routes (architecture audit M2).

Data-bound routes do synchronous SQLite + filesystem work. If they are declared
`async def` (with no `await`), FastAPI runs them directly on the event loop and
that blocking work stalls every other in-flight request. Declared as plain
`def`, FastAPI runs them in its threadpool instead. These routes must stay sync.

The reverse also matters (architecture audit C2): routes whose entire job is a
single external archive call (NASA/TOI TAP, ExoFOP, ADS) should be `async def`
using the shared httpx.AsyncClient (muscat_db.http_client), so FastAPI awaits
the I/O instead of occupying a threadpool slot for the whole request.

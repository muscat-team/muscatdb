"""Shared background-job lifecycle primitives for the photometry and
transit-fit pipelines.

Both pipelines launch external science tools as detached subprocesses
(``start_new_session=True``) whose multiprocessing workers keep appending to the
run log *after* the tracked parent process exits. Declaring a job terminal the
instant ``proc.poll()`` returns freezes the live-log view mid-output while the
Jobs page (which reads the log file directly) keeps advancing. This module is the
single source of truth for that lifecycle — the ``finalizing`` grace-window state
machine, the run-id / path-segment helpers, and the process-group kill helpers —
so the two pipelines cannot drift (architecture audit finding C1).

Pipeline-specific knobs (grace windows, the log lines that mark a pipeline's own
completion, and whether a zero-exit run can still be a partial failure) are
passed in via :class:`FinalizeConfig`; the callers build that config from their
own module-level, env-tunable settings on every call so those settings stay
monkeypatch-/override-able at runtime.

The module is intentionally dependency-free (stdlib only) to avoid an import
cycle: ``photometry`` and ``transit_fit`` import from here, never the reverse.

"""Linear ephemeris (transit-timing O-C) least-squares fitting.

Extracted from the ``api_ephemeris_calculate`` route handler in ``web.py``
(see notes/architecture_audit.md, finding H2) so the weighted/unweighted
least-squares fit, its variance propagation, and the epoch-centering trick
are independently unit-testable instead of living inline in a FastAPI route.

This module is output-identical to the historical inline implementation: same
formulas, same edge-case behavior (fewer than 2 usable points, or a singular
normal-equations matrix, both fall back to the reference ephemeris
unchanged). It intentionally does not introduce numpy/astropy so floating
point results match the prior implementation bit-for-bit.

    at the centered epoch ``E_center`` (numerically the best-determined
    point on the line, useful for display). When ``was_fit`` is False, all
    "_fit" fields equal the reference ``t0_ref``/``period_ref`` passed in and
    the uncertainties are 0.0.

    ``n_fit`` is the number of points passed in (``len(epochs)``); ``dof`` is
    ``n_fit - 2`` (the model has 2 free parameters, T0 and period). ``dof <=
    0`` means the fit has no residual degrees of freedom -- with exactly 2
    points (``fit_method="unweighted"``) the line interpolates them exactly,
    so ``residuals_sum_sq`` is 0 and the reported T0/period uncertainties are
    a hard 0.0, not a real precision estimate. Callers should treat a
    ``dof <= 0`` fit as unverified (no independent check that a straight
    line is the right model) and flag it rather than presenting the
    uncertainties at face value.

    is ``1 / uncs[i]**2``). Selecting which points are eligible (e.g. a
    "checked" flag from job bookkeeping) is caller business logic, not part
    of this pure-math function.

    With fewer than 2 points, or a singular normal-equations matrix (e.g. all

    - ``"weighted"``: inverse-variance weights (``1 / unc**2``); the
      T0/period uncertainties come directly from the weighted normal-equations
      covariance.
    - ``"unweighted"`` (default): uniform weights; the T0/period uncertainties
      are derived from the residual variance (``sum((tc - fit)**2) / dof``)
      propagated through the same covariance structure. ``uncs`` is unused in
      this mode other than being accepted for a uniform call signature.

    Epochs are centered at their mid-range value (``E_center``) before the
    regression -- this keeps the design matrix well-conditioned -- then the
    fit is extrapolated back to the catalog epoch (E=0), propagating the
    T0/period covariance term through the extrapolation.
